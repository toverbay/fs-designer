# FS Designer

Web-based 2D designer application. It currently draws rectangles! Yay!

- [ ] Add other shapes (ellipse, triangle, star, etc)
- [ ] Add path shapes (like svg path element)
- [ ] Group/ungroup shapes
- [ ] Change the order of shapes (move forward/backward, move to front/back)
- [ ] Select shapes (hit-testing)
- [ ] Scale, rotate, translate shapes (drag handles)
- [ ] Zoom/pan the workspace
- [ ] Show the origin in the workspace
- [ ] Rulers on the top and left side of the workspace for x and y coordinates
- [ ] Import SVGs
- [ ] Import rasters
- [ ] WebGL? WebCPU?

I'll be adding much more to this list as I progress.
